# bestof-web-paris-2015
Repo containing the code example from my talk for Best of Web 2015 in Paris.


## Prerequisite

Install nw.js via npm globally:
```
sudo npm install -g nw
```

Install nw.js via npm locally:
```
npm install nw
```

## Stream Booth

```
# Run the web NW.JS app
$ nw streambooth

# Then open your browser
# and visit http://localhost:3002

# It can work into a LAN (sometime with a large lag)

# This code is a workaround for making my demo,
# for real case, please check [PeerJS](http://peerjs.com)
```
